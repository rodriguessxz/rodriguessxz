- ⚡ A curious fact is that I started to be interested in progamming when I was around 13/14 years old and I was going to get my first computer, but I didnt understand anything. And I decided that I wanted a good machine, so I researchead and learned to make a good choice, and on this journey I became very interested in everything that encompasses technology.
